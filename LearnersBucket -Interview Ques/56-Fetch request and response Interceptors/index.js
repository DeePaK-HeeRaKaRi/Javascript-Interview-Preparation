// INterceptors works as a wall b/w client and server
// in request INterceptor when a req is sent by client to server the req is intercepted and ww can do diff types of processing and 
// we want to change anything and we want to update the headers we can do all those things and these will carry to server

// similarly in the response Inter once we get resp from server we can process it , we can check status and diff types of action
// and return back to client

// before sendng it to the server we have to process it in request Interceptor

// here overiding the original fetch method
